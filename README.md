# GUIDE

## SETUP

### Setup Conda

`conda activate historical-photo-sfm-pipeline`

`sudo apt update`

### Install Colmap

This project uses pycolmap which is a python wrapper for colmap, but it does not support dense MVS reconstruction due to lacking CUDA support, so lets just use the official colmap build.

See file `INSTALL_COLMAP.md` for more info

`sudo apt install ffmpeg`
